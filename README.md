# vs_code_mysql_connection
This projects aim to show you how you can access your MySQL databases using python in VS code. Retrieing data from databases is an inevitable process for data scientists as most companies store their data in the databases.

# Assumptions:
1. I am assuming that you already have MySQL properly installed and configured in your PC
2. You already have VS Code properly installed in your PC

# Modules/Packages rquired:
You will need to install a package that will be used to connect to the database

pip install mysql-connector-python

# Set Up a Python Script in VS code

Once you have the connector installed, you can write a python script to connect to your MySQL database.
